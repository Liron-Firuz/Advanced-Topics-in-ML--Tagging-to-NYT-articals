Abstract

In the information age in which we live, people are exposed to huge amounts of information every day. In this project we will explore different methods for cataloging articles from a news site for personalizing articles for the user.
In the project we will compare the methods: Tf Idf Vectorizer, LDA, KMeans, Hierarchical, And we will examine according to which information and which method is most useful for cataloging articles. The conclusion we got from this research is that the best method for cataloging articles is LDA using only the first most important keyword.

Introduction

In the world full of information we live in, people are exposed to a huge amount of information every day, the information they are exposed to is not necessarily the information they are interested in. The people want to be exposed only to information that interests them or that they feel is relevant to them.
News sites are one of the many platforms for accessing information for readers. The articles presented by the news sites are classified in advance by the writer who wrote them according to the section in which he works. When there will be software that can automatically match articles to interests, we will be able to produce an interface tailored to each individual user just by using the words in the articles they read or another information that can be relevant from those article.
In this project we investigate different methods for classifying article categories based on a database of articles from the popular news site "New York Times". We believe that classifying articles according to what is written in them will allow a good classification of categories relevant to the user.
Since there is no access to the users' personal information, we will investigate a database of articles with a predetermined classification to examine whether the classification of those articles according to the algorithms is really relevant and correctly classified.
