What Driving Can Teach Us About Living,How we respond to the rules of the road offers insight into being human.,"Where I live, there is always someone driving slowly on the road ahead. This is by the sea in the English countryside, and the roads are narrow and burrow-like, with high hedges on either side to protect the fields from the coastal winds. The roads are digressive in character, rarely traveling directly to a specific location. They branch across the flat fields like veins. It is hard to see what’s coming, and because there aren’t many vantage points, it’s easy to get lost. Still, it’s nothing that requires excessive caution. There’s no particular reason for alarm, in fact quite the reverse. Yet people drive at 15, 20, 30 miles an hour.

Poem: One-Way Gate,Selected by Rita Dove.,"Entering the new year invariably invites introspection, even when shuttling cattle to market. Jenny George’s exquisitely spare meditation never allows us to stray from the harsh realities of rural subsistence; the livestock’s wintry snorts may recall the warm breath of just-baked bread, but cold muck still tugs underfoot. Depending on your position in the hierarchy of survival, the cycle of life could shift significantly. For the cattle herd, there is no turning around; for “good girls” of the human persuasion, however, there are ways to look back while pushing ahead — if we remember that beginnings, like endings, can happen any time.

Five Places to Visit in Beverly Hills,"Beverly Hills is an expensive place with a village-like charm, but it pays to know where to go.

What to Cook This Weekend,This may very well be the year of pepperoni-topped pizzas drizzled with ranch dressing.,"Good morning.

But when he tried it, the apple was, in his words, mind-blowing. “It’s a really delicious, complex apple that has all these wonderfully nutty and cidery notes — like chestnuts and hot apple cider,” he says. “It tastes like the Instagram filter you’d pick for a photo of autumn leaves.” From then on, he was hooked, spending hours, and eventually years, researching apple varieties and the history of the fruit.",APPLES,"apple, like, really","appl, like, would","odd, apple, william","fruit, varieti, rare","one, photographer, delicious"

Shortcut Cooking From Jamie Oliver,"In “5 Ingredients,” the chef offers recipes for everyday meals, and some showstoppers, too.","Clever cookbooks with a limited number of ingredients per recipe are not new, but this one from the chef Jamie Oliver is notable for its ease and verve. Before he gets to the cooking he names his five “pantry heroes”: red wine vinegar, sea salt, black pepper and two olive oils, everyday and finer for finishing, staples that are not part of the ingredient tally. The book starts with salads, mostly as the center of the plate, and then goes on to simple pastas like one with canned tuna, capers and tiny tomatoes. There are sections on eggs, chicken, fish, various meats (beef dishes are mostly steaks) and desserts. To keep the ingredient count to five, Mr. Oliver bakes with self-rising flour and premade puff pastry and relies on prepared Asian condiments and sauces. With coconut milk and curry paste, you’re on your way to soup.

It comes in a deep bowl filled with slices of beef, bok choy, pickled cabbage and his hand-pulled noodles, an art that he has managed to perfect.

They decorate their bowers with scores of colorful objects, like flowers, berries, snail shells or, if they are near an urban area, bottle caps and plastic cutlery. Some bowerbirds even arrange the items in their collection from smallest to largest, forming a walkway that makes themselves and their trinkets all the more striking to a female — an optical illusion known as forced perspective that humans did not perfect until the 15th century.","Prum, Richard O","bowerbird, male, flame","bowerbird, centuri, 15th","extravagant, splendor, animal","come, alon, select","beauty, making, scientist"

There was also a lot of talk among us about taking out any reference to social issues in the promotional materials, whether domestic violence or child abuse, and I was like, “I guess that makes sense.” But I’m torn about the effect that’s had, because on the one hand, the film is doing exactly what I want it to — young people who would go seek out a skateboard film anyway, it seems to be destroying them by the end emotionally.

How to Choose the Best Clay Mask for Your Skin,"The earthy ingredient takes a more sophisticated turn in a number of new facial remedies, from melting creams to sheet masks.","Clay might not be the most high-tech beauty ingredient — the fine, earthy sediment has been used in facial remedies for centuries — but it’s one of the most efficient. When used in a paste or scrub, it is particularly adept at temporarily removing “surface oil and bacteria,” says the New York City dermatologist Rachel Nazarian, and can lead to a cleaner, brighter-looking complexion. Yet, slathering on clay is not always pleasant: The mineral-rich substance has the texture of thick mud, is messy to apply and often becomes dry and flaky when spread on the face. But there is a better way.

Though rumors of Harris gearing up for a presidential run in 2020 are becoming noisier by the minute (when Stephen Colbert asked her on Thursday if she would run, Harris coyly said, “I might”), she told me the memoir is not meant to help lay the groundwork for such a campaign. “At the expense of sounding immodest,” she said, the book is “really about the work I’ve done already that’s had national impact, and what I hope to come from it.” Below, Harris talks about how she connects personal experiences to her professional life, the breakneck speed of the news cycle, the inspiration she takes from Bob Marley and more.","Harris, Kamala D","harris, memoir, night","harri, said, run","harris, discus, new","inhabit, landscap, polit","kamala, harris, talk"

A Book That Gets to the Bottom of Green-Bean Casserole,“American Advertising Cookbooks” looks at how big food brands helped shape the American palate.,"The masterful tentacles of advertising and public relations have manipulated the American table for more than a century.

A key player was Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, who in the 1920s helped pioneer the use of psychology to target women through advertising.

When I first met him, on the campus of Yale University, where he is chairman of the playwriting program — one of the most exclusive in the country, admitting only three students each year — it struck me that he was, if not distant, then at the very least aloof. Small talk was made and pleasantries exchanged, but I couldn’t help noticing that there was not much eye contact. At first I attributed this to normal self-consciousness, but as the day progressed it occurred to me that it might be a kind of honesty: He wouldn’t do me or himself the disrespect of offering a charm performance. He simply said it was nice to meet me and suggested we get a bite at a nearby Cuban restaurant. Once there, he looked over the menu for not long at all before ordering the eggplant steak and then, as if on impulse, an empanada de guayaba and a cafe con leche.

Reading Proust in the Gulag,What books do we turn to as we prepare to die?,"What books do we reach for when we know that we soon will die? And do we read to prepare ourselves for death, as the ancient Egyptians did with the “Book of the Dead,” or to distract ourselves from it — to break from the crisis of the present? Dying of leukemia in 2004, Susan Sontag carried “Don Quixote” with her to radiation treatments, and blitzed through “Persepolis” in her hospital bed at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Sigmund Freud, dying of mouth cancer, read Balzac’s “The Wild Ass’s Skin,” refusing all painkillers save aspirin to maintain his lucidity. In Saul Bellow’s final novel, “Ravelstein,” the secular protagonist, modeled on the philosopher Allan Bloom, finds himself unexpectedly drawn to the sacred as he is dying of AIDS: “If he had to choose between Athens and Jerusalem, among us the two main sources of higher life, he chose Athens, while full of respect for Jerusalem.

But he also wanted a place where he could cook intimate lunches and host the occasional party (every year, during Paris’s annual Fête de la Musique, he invites up to 500 of his friends into the studio to watch world-renowned D.J.s). The studio’s design, while delightfully unconventional — with its rounded blond-wood walls, nylon strap and net railings and floating portal-like doors — is precisely tailored to Veilhan’s needs.",Cooking and Cookbooks,"studio, place, work","studio, work, place","xavier, veilhan, unconventional","meal, midday, approach","artist, cook, lunch"

Outrunning Hunger,Intense exercise may change the way certain neurons influence our appetite and metabolism.,"Exercise and eating have a fraught, unsettled relationship with each other. Workouts can blunt or boost appetites. People who start an exercise program often overeat and gain weight — and yet studies and lived experience demonstrate that regular exercise is needed to avoid regaining the weight lost during a successful diet. Intrigued by these contradictory outcomes, researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, along with colleagues from other institutions, ran an experiment on the melanocortin circuit, a brain network in the hypothalamus known to be involved in metabolism. The resulting study, published in December in Molecular Metabolism, suggests that intense exercise might change the workings of certain neurons in ways that could have beneficial effects on appetite and metabolism.",Exercise,"exercise, metabolism, appetite","exercis, metabol, weight","intense, exercise, may","metabol, appetit, influenc","outrunning, hunger"

Finding the Comedy in Tween Tragedy,"A novel from Meg Wolitzer and Holly Goldberg Sloan, a revamp of the Baby-Sitters Club, and more in the latest funny books for middle-grade readers.","Mel Brooks said it best. “To me, tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die.” When you’re 12, though, the line between comedy and tragedy can thin to the point of translucence. Teetering on the cusp of adolescence, many kids feel that compared with the threat of embarrassment, walking into an open sewer is rather enticing. Yet the freshest fears yield the greatest comedic bounty. True schadenfreude is built on seeing your fellow humans fail with epic splendor. That’s where books come in. Rather than encourage average kids’ bloodthirsty instinct to cheer for the downfall of their friends and neighbors, let them delve into the fiascos of fictional characters.

Diderot Was Way Ahead of His Time — and He Knew It,"Andrew S.

Curran’s “Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely” will, among other things, make you feel very lazy. On a typical day, Curran points out, Diderot might “write on ancient Chinese and Greek music first thing in the morning, study the mechanics of a cotton mill until noon, help purchase some paintings for Catherine the Great in the afternoon, and then return home and compose a play and a 20-page letter to his mistress in the evening.” The 18th-century French philosopher (he was called “le philosophe” by his contemporaries; “the philosopher,” not “a philosopher”) was the most famous atheist of his generation. He edited the “Encyclopédie,” for which he wrote 7,000 articles. He was also an art critic, a novelist, a political writer and a satirist, though much of this was known only long after his death. He wrote dozens of manuscripts that he meant to be discovered after he was gone, hoping and trusting that future generations would better sympathize with his more radical thoughts.

What she less overtly advertised, though, was her fiercely independent life. Athill died last week at the age of 101, and her words, at several critical points in this reader’s life, provided a lifeline.

But it also means something more poignant: the end of your character’s journey. (At least until the show’s reboot.) While television characters are immortal in a way — living on even after the show is done — when the story reaches its conclusion, so, too, does the time an actor has spent getting to know the characters in that world.

‘The Wild Pear Tree’ Review: A Gambler and a Writer at Odds,Modern Turkey is the backdrop for a father-son story rich with literary overtones and philosophical implications.,"“The Wild Pear Tree,” Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s latest film, shares its title with a manuscript written by its protagonist, a restless young man named Sinan. The book is a collection of short pieces, quasi- or semi-fictional but based in reality, touching on aspects of life in the part of western Turkey where Sinan (Aydin Dogu Demirkol) and his family live. Pitching the manuscript to a local government official he thinks might subsidize its publication, the author is at pains to describe it in resolutely anti-commercial terms. Though the area includes the battle sites of both Troy and Gallipoli, there is nothing of historical or touristic interest in the work. It’s defiantly cerebral — resistant to summary, classification and perhaps easy comprehension as well.

Over the past three decades, soybeans have gone from being a tiny part of Argentina’s agriculture-dependent economy to occupying nearly 50 percent of its cultivated land.

How to Win an Argument,Don’t lead with your strongest points. Anticipate miscommunication.

It isn’t enough, in other words, to dwell only on the strengths of your own position. Accept that an issue like whether to increase the minimum wage, for example, can have strong reasons on both sides. “I could give very good considerations in favor of my side of the policy,” Mashwama says, “but those might not be relevant in light of the actual reasons my opponent has an opposing opinion.” This is common on social media, he adds; too often, people aren’t listening to one another.

How Iran’s Greatest Director Makes Art of Moral Ambiguity,Asghar Farhadi’s films fill theaters in a country where taking sides can be dangerous. They’ve also captivated Hollywood.,"Asghar Farhadi, the most successful director in the history of Iranian cinema, may have little interest in global politics, but global politics are interested in him. On Jan. 27, 2017, less than a week after “The Salesman,” Farhadi’s seventh feature film, was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language movie, President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, more commonly known as the Muslim ban. Under its terms, citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran among them, were barred from entering the United States for 90 days — apparently the time it would take the new president to figure out “what the hell is going on.” For Farhadi, a connoisseur of human particularity whose nuanced, open-ended films about the cultural fault lines within Iran have been embraced by audiences around the world, Trump’s order was an offense both moral and intellectual. In a statement released two days later, he announced his decision to boycott the Oscars and also alluded to the history of “reciprocal humiliation” that lay behind present-day American-Iranian hostilities. Given the circumstances (the collective punishment of an entire religious group), that “reciprocal” showed extraordinary equanimity — not that anyone who had seen the film for which Farhadi was nominated, a painstaking psychological inquest into the rival claims of reciprocally humiliated parties, would have been surprised.",Movies,"farhadi, film, day","farhadi, reciproc, would","asghar, farhadi, film","hollywood, captiv, also","iran, greatest, director"
"Does ‘Creative’ Work Free You From Drudgery, or Just Security?",One result of our obsession with creative jobs: You may now be expected to live like a starving artist in order to work for a massive corporation.,"For a few days, a couple of weeks ago, a small but influential corner of the media world was transfixed by the story of Caroline Calloway and her Creativity Workshop. Calloway is a 27-year-old with a large Instagram following, built by chronicling her time as an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge (picturesque lolling on the banks of the River Cam) and her daily life as a gal-about-town in New York City. Early in January, she announced to her 830,000 followers that she would be holding a series of four-hour, $165 seminars in several American cities, a chance for fans to meet Calloway and imbibe some of her wisdom on “true creative fulfillment.” What followed was a fiasco: Early seminars failed to deliver promised amenities, and Calloway turned out to have sold tickets to some events without having located venues for them. A muckraking Twitter thread materialized, scorning Calloway as a “scammer”; she promptly canceled and then uncanceled the tour, all while zapping out flurries of alternately self-flagellating and self-justifying posts on Instagram Stories.",Creativity,"calloway, story, instagram","calloway, self, seminar","one, result, obsession","corpor, massiv, work","creative, work, free"

As far back as the 1860s, a patrician British contingent was spending the cold months in the winter sun here; by the 1960s, the jet set had anointed St. Moritz the hallowed ski spot of wealthy scions and the internationally fabulous. In the town’s handful of streets jumbled along the western banks of St. Moritz Lake, the German- and Romansch-speaking enclave is home to a mere 5,200 citizens, joined by more than half a million glamour-hungry visitors each year. Amid all the dazzle and dizzying prices though, the town’s roots endure: Swiss, snowbound and sports-obsessed. Tourist life remains old-fashioned, revolving around the ski lodges and the storied Kulm, the slope-side Suvretta and the buzz-filled Badrutt’s Palace, the grand hotels where heavy Alpine furniture never goes out of style; piano players still serenade the lounge-dwellers and old- and new-moneyed denizens alike sip champagne under dim chandeliers.",Travel and Vacations,"town, st, moritz","ski, moritz, st","scenic, swiss, town","meal, alpin, robust","36, hour, st"
